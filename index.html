          Come relax in the mountains at the Red Bridge Cottage.  This charming 1930’s river rock home is in the heart of Hot Springs!  Walk out the front door, and you’ll be right across the street from the famous natural Hot Springs Spa that gives the town its namesake. Take a few steps in the other direction and you’re in the quaint downtown. Walk a little further to the campground, and if you’re lucky, you’ll catch one of the many fun festivals. Cross the bridge and go for a hike on Lovers Leap trail or the Appalachian Trail which runs right through downtown. Or maybe you walked out the back door, and you found a huge back yard, whimsical patio, and a fire pit right on Spring Creek. Relax, fish, play, sip, eat, and sleep to the rippling water.  Enjoy your gallerys outside on the patio or at the picnic table down by the river. You really can park the car for your entire vacation if you like! Yet, a short car ride away opens you to all kinds of adventure:  hiking, white water rafting, kayaking, tubing, fishing, mountain biking, ziplining, and horseback trail rides.
